      <t>There have been several proposed solutions with BIER being used in IPv6. But there
      hasn't been a document which describes the problem and lists the requirements. 
      The goal of this document is to describe the general BIER IPv6 encapsulation problem, 
      summarize the encapsulation modes of the proposed solutions, detail solution requirements, 
      and assist the working group in the development of acceptable solutions.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>Bit Index Explicit Replication (BIER) <xref target="RFC8279"/> is an
      architecture that provides optimal multicast forwarding, without
      requiring intermediate routers to maintain per-flow state, through the
      use of a multicast-specific BIER header. <xref target="RFC8296"/>
      defines two types of BIER encapsulation: one is
      BIER MPLS encapsulation for MPLS environments,
	  the other is non-MPLS BIER encapsulation to run without MPLS.
	  This document describes using
      BIER in non-MPLS IPv6 environments. We explain the requirements of
      transporting IPv4/IPv6 multicast overlay payload through an IPv6 network
	  underlay using BIER. The solutions may require the use of IPv6
	  forwarding plane and may include IPv6 encapsulation and/or generic
	  IPv6 tunnelling.

    <section title="Problem Statement">
      
      <t>The problem is how to transport BUM packets using BIER technology in an non-MPLS IPv6 environment.
      With IPv6 encapsulation increasingly used for unicast services like VPN or L2VPN,
      It may also be desired to have BIER deployments, for multicast services such as MVPN, using IPv6 encapsulation. On the other hand, since BIER has its own
	  encapsulation, IPv6 encapsulation is not required, even though
	  IPv6 encapsulation (native or GRE/UDP-like) may be used
	  to transport BIER packets over some BIER-incapable routers.
      </t>
      
      <t>Below is a simple scenario that needs BIER IPv6-based forwarding:</t>

      <t>This scenario depicts the need to replicate BIER packets from a
      BFIR to BFERs across an IPv6 Service Provider core.   
	  Inside the IPv6 network, the BIER header is used to direct the packet from one BFR to the next BFRs, 
	  and either IPv6 header or Ethernet header is used to provide reachability between BFRs.
	  The IPv6 environment may include a variety of link types, may be entirely IPv6, 
	  or may be dual stack. There may be cases where not all routers 
	  are BFR capable in the IPv6 environment but still want to deploy BIER.
	  Regardless of the environment, the problem is to deploy BIER in a non-MPLS IPv6 network.

    <section title="Conceptual Models For BIER IPv6 Encapsulation and Forwarding">
    <t>This analysis introduces two conceptual models for BIER in IPv6 networks
     based on the experience and solutions discussed in the IETF community. </t>
    
      <section title="Independent Model">
		<t>The first conceptual model is an Independent Model, where IPv6
		is nothing special to BIER but a transportation means that may be used
		just like other transportation means, and BIER is nothing special to
		IPv6 but a payload type just like other payload types. </t>

  <-----> BIER(P2MP) tunnel
      ]]></artwork>
        </figure></t>
        <t>In this model, an IPv6 tunnel works as a link-layer of BIER, and BIER works as a layer-2.5
		over tunnels or L2 links. Between two BFRs, either a L2 link can be used directly or any tunnel (IPv6 or not) 
		can be used for BIER transport. In the tunnel case, the transmitting BFR adds tunnel encapsulation (e.g. IPv6 header) and 
		the receiving BFR removes the tunnel encapsulation.
        </t>
         
        <t>General consideration of this model is to keep BIER and IPv6
		independent of each other. The BIER header is not part of the IPv6
		header but comes after the transport
		header (L2 or tunnel header) and before BIER payload.</t>
         
      </section>
      
      <section title="Integrated Model">
      <t>The second conceptual model is an Integrated Model that integrates BIER as part of the IPv6 data plane, 
      making it a "Layer-3 BIER" approach.</t>

        </figure></t>
        <t>In this model, BIER works as part of the IPv6 data plane. 
        The BFIR and BFERs work as IPv6 (P2MP) tunnel endpoints, and BFRs 
        work as IPv6 segment endpoints. The BIER header is processed on each segment endpoint and there 
        is no decapsulation, or re-encapsulation, on the segment endpoints. </t>
        
        <t>This model typically needs an IPv6 extension header to carry the BIER header. 
        and processing of 
         the BIER header (e.g., the BitString) will be implemented as part of the IPv6 extension header processing. 
         The IPv6 source address is the BIER packet source-origin identifier, and is unchanged through the 
         BIER domain from BFIR to BFERs. </t>
         
         <t>General consideration of this model is to use the IPv6 capabilities integrated, in addition to normal BIER function, 
         to facilitate new requirements that may emerge in an IPv6 network.</t>

    </section>

    <section title="Requirements">
      <t>There are several suggested requirements for BIER IPv6 solutions. </t>
      
      <t>In this document, the requirements are divided into two levels: Mandatory and Optional. 
      The requirement levels are determined based on the following factors: </t>
      <t></t>
       <t>Potential deployment and impact: <list style="">
       <t>If the requirement is required for a feature that is likely to be a potential deployment, the requirement level will be considered mandatory. </t>
       <t>If the impact of not implementing the requirement may block BIER from been deployed, the requirement level will be considered mandatory.</t>
       </list></t>
      <t></t>
       <t>Applicability to one specific model or both models: <list style="">
       <t>If a requirement is common sense from existing BIER practice, and is applicable to both models, the requirement level will be considered mandatory. </t>
       <t>If a requirement is deduced from a specific model, and hasn't been well-known, the requirement level will be considered optional and 
       listed as a topic to further discuss.</t>
       </list></t>         
      <t></t>
      
    <section title="Mandatory Requirements">  
      <t>Considering that these mandatory requirements are all well-known to the working group, and practical in normal deployment, 
      they will be listed without a detailed description.
      </t>
      <section title="Support various L2 link types">
        <t>The solution should support various kind of L2 data link types.</t>
      </section>
      
      <section title="Support BIER architecture">
        <t>The solution must support the BIER architecture. </t>

        <t>Suppporting different multicast flow overlays, multiple sub-domains, multi-topologies,
		multiple sets, multiple Bit String Lengths,
		and deterministic ECMP are considered essential functions of BIER and need to be supported.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Support deployment with Non-BFR routers">
        <t>The solution must support deployments with BIER-incapable routers.
        This is beneficial to the deployment of BIER, especially 
        in early deployments when some routers do not support 
        BIER forwarding but support IPv6 forwarding. </t>
      </section>
      
      <section title="Support OAM">
      <t>BIER OAM should be supported, either directly using existing methods, 
      or by specifying a new method for the same functionality.
      It may be considered essential as part of the BIER architecture in some cases. </t>
      </section>
      
      </section>
      
    <section title="Optional Requirements">
      <t>The requirements in this section are listed as optional, and each requirement is explained with a detailed scenario.
      </t>
      
      <section title="Support Fragmentation">
      <t>There are some cases where the Fragmentation/Assembly function is needed for BIER to work in an IPv6 network. </t>
      <t>For example, a customer IPv6 multicast packet may be 1280 bytes and is required to be transported through an IPv6 network using BIER. 
         Every link of the IPv6 network is no less than the requisite 1280 bytes <xref target="RFC8200"/>, 
         but the size of the payload that can be encapsulated in BIER (BIER-MTU) is less than 1280 bytes.
         In this case, it is not the appropriate action for a BFIR to drop the packet and advertise an MTU to the source <xref target="RFC8296"/>. 
         Instead, the IPv6 transport mechanism, either integrated with or independent to BIER, need to provide the fragmentation and assembly function.
      </t>
  		
      </section>
      
      <section title="Support IPSEC ESP">
      <t>There are some cases where the IPSEC ESP function may be needed to transport c-multicast packets through an IPv6 network with 
      confidentiality using BIER technology.</t>
      <t>A service provider may want to provide additional security SLA to its customer to ensure that the unencrypted c-multicast packet is 
      not altered in the service provider's network. In this case, if the BIER technology is preferred for the multicast service, BIER with IPSEC 
      ESP support may be a candidate solution. On the other hand, the traffic
	  protection may be better provided via IPSEC or MACSEC at multicast flow overlay
	  over and beyond the BIER domain.
      </t>
      </section>
    </section>

    </section>

    <section title="IANA Considerations">
      <t>Some BIER IPv6 encapsulation proposals do not require any action from
      IANA while other proposals require new IPv6 Option
      codepoints from IPv6 sub-registries, new "Next header" values, or
      require new IP Protocol codes. This document, however, does not require
      anything from IANA.</t>

    <section title="List of Solutions">
      <t>There have been some proposed solutions for BIER in
      IPv6 environments. Some solutions propose encoding while others propose
      encapsulation. It is recommended for the wg to evaluate these solutions against
      the requirements listed previously in order to make informed decisions on solution 
      readiness.</t>
      
      <t>This section lists these solutions categorizing in the two conceptual models.</t>
      
      <section title="Integrated mode approach">
        <t>One example of this model is defined in <xref target="I-D.pfister-bier-over-ipv6"/>, where the
        information required for BIER forwarding, 
        e.g., the BitString, is encoded in the low-order bits of the
        IPv6 destination address of each packet. The high-order bits of the
        IPv6 destination address are used by intermediate routers for unicast
        forwarding, deciding whether a packet is a BIER packet, and if so, to
        identify the BIER Sub-Domain, Set Identifier and BitString length.
        The BIER function is integrated in the IPv6 header and its forwarding procedure, and the BIER payload is encapsulated as the IPv6 payload.</t>

        e.g., the BIER header, is encoded in an Option TLV (indicated by a TLV Type to be allocated by IANA) of 
        the IPv6 Destination Option Header. 
		The BIER function is integrated in IPv6 extension header and its forwarding procedure, and the BIER payload is encapsulated as the IPv6 payload.</t>
